### What is NFT?
NFT is a digital asset with unique identity that is saved and verified on the blockchain (digital ledger). Each NFT is irreplaceable, which means it cannot be easily exchanged for another asset of similar value. Common NFT assets include images, video, music, GIF and collectibles. 
NFT is valuable because there is only one version of the asset created. In other words, NFT can only have one owner at a time-no one can change its ownership or cast the same NFT on the blockchain. Given this scarcity, the founders / owners of NFT have the ability to set their own interest rates on their assets.
### How does NFT work?
NFT needs to create digital tokens through a technique called cryptography. In the encrypted world, this token creation process is called minting. Typically, to cast a NFT, you must pay for creating a smart contract using cryptocurrency.
Smart contracts are pieces of software code that allow blockchains to store information in a secure and transparent manner. Ultimately, this code manages the ownership and transferability of the NFT.
### Who can create NFT?
Anyone with a small amount of money can cast NFT. Today's NFT platform provides tools that allow you to create various NFT and attach unlockable content to your files. Whether you are an artist, musician, collector, entrepreneur, or company, you can use the simple casting tools available in the NFT market to create your own NFT.
#### Popular examples of NFT
Before delving into the nature of NFT production, let's review some popular NFT examples for inspiration. 
1. Daily life: the first 5000 days

The NFT is a digital collage of 5000 images created by digital artist Mike Winkelmann (professional name Beeple). It was cast as a JPG document and sold for a record $69.3 million at a large auction house in 2021. The value of this NFT lies in the 5000 futuristic images produced by Beeple every day from May 1, 2007 to January 7, 2021.
two。 Rainbow cat GIF

One of the cool things about NFT is that anyone can turn their creation into a unique asset. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of its birth, the creators of Nyan Cat decided to convert the popular GIF into NFT and auction it. Can you guess what won the bid? 300 ethernet tokens! (according to the price of Taifang at the time of this writing, it is more than $950000. )
3. Boring ape yacht club

Bored Ape Yacht Club is the highest-paid NFT collection, with 10000 cartoon apes. This was the idea of four friends who were inspired to use apes as their social avatars, because "ape entry" is a term for people who buy a new NFT regardless of the risks involved. They hardly know that a few years later, everyone from entrepreneurs to celebrities will imitate and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on their work. (just recently, Eminem bought Bored Ape NFT for $462000. )
4. Doge NFT

Just as collectors spend heavily on cult toys and rare goods, Doge NFT shows how digital scarcity makes iconic creations valuable. In June 2021, the fanatical meme of a smirking firewood dog named Kabosu was sold for $4 million. Interestingly, the NFT investor group that bought NFT now sells its partial ownership, which means anyone can own a piece for as little as $1. 
### How to create and cast NFT
Now let's talk about the meat. Let's look at the basic steps for making our own NFT. Keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive guide. Depending on the tool you use, there are several ways to do this, so use these tips as general guidelines.
1. Decide what type of NFT you want to create
NFT has a wide range of uses-you have a variety of options to choose the type you want to create. Your choices include works of art, event tickets, memes, media and music, games, virtual items and more. You can even create NFT for real-life objects, such as valuable photos signed by collectors or celebrities.
They are usually in the form of image, audio or video files, such as JPG, PNG, MP4, MOV and so on.
If you decide to do a simple NFT, you don't necessarily need a developer. But if your NFT is a more complex item, such as a game, or has a complex smart contract (terms of sale), you may need the help of a developer.
When making your first NFT, consider how to provide value to your audience. If you already have a business, you can try to create a membership card or exclusive promotion code. You can always hire an artist to create custom works of art for you.
two。 Select a NFT market
When it comes to finding where to cast your work, there are plenty of NFT markets to choose from. For sellers, each NFT market has its own advantages and disadvantages, so be sure to study it before making a choice. Three of the most popular are OpenSea, Rarible and SolSea.

These platforms make it easier for new creators to enter the world of NFT. Some require you to verify or write your NFT on the blockchain, while others such as OpenSea and Rarible allow "shortcuts", such as delayed coinage. In lazy casting, you can avoid some fees by selling the NFT instead of writing it into the blockchain, and then pass it on to your buyer (if you buy it).
One of the most important considerations for beginners is cost, often referred to as "gas". Each market has its own costs, depending on how you plan to build and sell NFT. For example, OpenSea has to pay a fee to initialize your account, which in some cases can be as high as $100.
3. Set up an encrypted wallet
The next step is to create a digital wallet to store cryptocurrency and NFT. An important factor to consider when choosing a wallet is whether it is compatible with the blockchain and NFT market you intend to use to cast NFT. 
Although there is no shortage of encrypted wallets, most NFT creators use MetaMask browsers to extend wallets. The wallet is easy to set up and connects to most of the block chains used to create and trade NFT, including Ethernet Square and Min Security Smart chains. Other common wallets are Enjin, AlphaWallet and Trust Wallet. 
Note: most NFT wallets are browser-based, which means they are as secure as the underlying browser applications. For maximum security, we recommend investing in hardware wallets such as Ledger Nano X. The hardware wallet stores your private key offline and is used to manage various coins and NFT assets on the blockchain.
4. Purchase cryptocurrency through the exchange
Once you have created your wallet, you can buy some cryptocurrency so you can pay for gasoline to cast your NFT. The best way is to create an account on a reputable exchange, such as Binance, Kraken, or Crypto.com. The process is very simple and can be done on a smartphone.
Now that you have an account, you can log in and purchase cryptocurrency. For NFT casting, you need to buy ETH or Solana (SOL) coins, depending on which block chain you want to cast. When you are finished, transfer your coins to the wallet you set in the previous step. 
To transfer money from the exchange to your encrypted wallet:
-log in to the exchange.
-Open the Wallet tab in the top or bottom navigation.
-Click on the withdrawal and select the relevant currency.
-enter the address of your wallet in the address field.
-Select the correct network (ETH is ERC-20,SOL and Solana).
- Enter the amount and click Withdraw.
5. Connect the wallet to the NFT platform and cast

After you recharge your wallet, you need to connect it to the NFT platform used to create digital assets. Let's explain the steps you need to take (we'll use the Rarible Marketplace as an example).
1. Go to Rarible.com and click the Connect Wallet button in the upper right corner of the screen.
two。 Select your digital wallet (for example, MetaMask) and grant Rarible permission to view your account. 
3. Click Connect and accept the platform's terms of service and age confirmation.
4. Return to the home page of Rarible, and then click the blue create button in the upper right corner.
5. You can choose to create a single digital copy of NFT, or you can create multiple copies to sell the same product multiple times.
6. Upload the digital file you want to cast as NFT. 
Next, you are asked to choose how to sell your NFT files. Assets are created without forcing them to be sold. You can also sell it after casting and set the lowest price. 
7. Choose whether you want to provide a full, high-resolution version of NFT, or add unlockable content through a secret download link or web page.
8. Select Rarible as the collection of NFT.
9. Add the title and description of NFT's work of art. 
10. Specify a percentage of the royalties you want to receive for secondary sales. 
11. Specifies the properties of the file, such as color or size in pixels. 
twelve。 Click create Project.
13. Approve the transaction in your encrypted wallet (pay for gas).
14. Click OK > upload files and Mint tokens.
15. Confirm the contract integration in the wallet (creating a smart contract will charge a small gas fee). 
16. Click "sign in" in your wallet to sign the sale order.
okay. Your NFT has now been cast. To find the NFT you created, click profile > my Project. Your NFT collection will pop up on your screen. 
### Your own NFT is not as far away as you think.
When you hear about NFT for the first time, you may find it too complex or impossible to really enter the market. But through some thorough research, diligence and creativity, it is easier to achieve than it seems.
Who knows: if you play well, one day you may join the multimillion-dollar NFT club!
### How to create NFT FAQ
#### How much does it cost to make a NFT?
The cost of casting NFT usually varies based on Gas fees and site costs. For example, on the Ethereum blockchain, you need to pay around $70 to get tokens. Websites cost about $300 on average, although some sites allow you to list NFT for free.
#### Can I cast NFT for free?
This is possible if you choose the NFT platform that supports delayed casting. This process generates metadata for NFT without actually creating tokens for NFT itself. When someone buys the NFT, it will be formally cast, and the resulting Gas fees will be passed on to the buyer. Keep in mind that the cost may surprise those who try to buy your work. So while you can avoid seigniorage, you may end up paying the price for missing out on sales and portfolio opportunities.
