A lot of tests have been done on github api before, mainly the addition, deletion, deletion and modification of the file system requires a SHA string to operate on the existing files on API,github, through the
```txt
/repos/:userId/:repo/contents/:path

```
This interface gets the file info, which has the sha field.
Before doing this program, blog updates mainly relied on local node.js scripts, but now they simply call api to update remote files directly.

Recently, github collapsed, and I don't feel safe to keep my blog on github for a long time. I'd like to buy an independent server in the future.
