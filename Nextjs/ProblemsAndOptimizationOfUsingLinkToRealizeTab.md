If the Tab in the page is implemented as a Link page, there will be a problem, that is, when you click back, you cannot directly exit the current page, but return to the state of the previous tab.
Because Link is the browser routing stack, each click on Link will push a new record in history, so you can only go back to the last time you clicked Link.
Optimization: next/link provides the replace option to indicate whether or not to replace the current history, that is, it will not add a new history but directly replace the current one.
