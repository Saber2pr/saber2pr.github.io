### 2018.7.7-2018.9
[MyWeb](https://github.com/Saber2pr/MyWeb)
Before that, I used jq+bootstrap+requirejs to build a simple blog, which was mainly used to introduce my hobbies. Repo is the current saber2pr/MyWeb, but the page code has been deleted and is now only stored as an image resource and the demo of each project after build.

### 2018.9-2018.10
[Vue-tabpage](https://saber2pr.top/vue-tabpage/dist/)
Use vue/cli to write a simple blog, mainly used to show online demo. Pure vue, no libraries involving vue ecology, such as vuex, etc. (but it's easy to learn.)
The component:is label switching subassembly is used to implement route switching.

### 2018.10-2019
[React-tabpage](https://saber2pr.top/react-tabpage/build/)
Vue-tabpage was rewritten using create-react-app. Use the render children switchover sub-component to achieve route switching. React ecology is not involved, such as redux and so on. (but it's easy to learn.)

### 2019.3-2019.4
[React.org-like](https://saber2pr.top/react.org-like/build/)
Referring to the UI style of react's official website, use the react technology stack to build a blog from 0. Or create-react-app.
Use Typescript and Less coding, and use your own router library. React ecology is still not involved, such as redux and so on. (but it's easy to learn.)

### 2019.7.7-so far
[Saber2pr.github.io](https://saber2pr.top)
Large area reconstruction is carried out on the basis of react.org-like. Remove the create-react-app framework and configure webpack on demand starting at 0.
#### Domain name DNS resolution and HTTPS encryption
In September, I bought the.top domain name in Alibaba Cloud, configured DNS resolution, and used my own domain name to access the website. The website was upgraded from http://saber2pr.github.io to http://saber2pr.top.
Let's Encrypt Authority X3 encryption is applied for on Github. Upgrade the website from http://saber2pr.top to https://saber2pr.top.
